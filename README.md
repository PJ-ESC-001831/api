# co-maker/api

API backend and integration services for co-maker.

## Getting Started

This is an express service that provides a RESTful API for the co-maker application. This is written in typescript and you will be working in a Node.js environment. The development environment is set up using Docker and devcontainers along with the VSCode Remote Containers extension (ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack).

Steps to get started with the development environment:
1. Make sure you have Docker installed on your machine.
2. Install the VSCode Remote Containers extension (ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack).
3. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and fill in the necessary values.
3. In the root of the project, open the command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) and select "Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container".

This will open the project in a containerized environment with all the necessary dependencies installed.
